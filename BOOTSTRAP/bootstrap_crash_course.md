# Bootstrap
[For this lesson, I am following Traversy Media's course linked here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sosXZsdy-s)

## Intro Notes
Bootstrap is a CSS framework for websites. It is a standardized group of styles that can be applied without writing any CSS.

You can go in, modify the Sass files, compile them, and then change what the framework will do, but that's complicated...

<strong>[Bootstrap documentation can be found here.](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)</strong>

<em>[I also came across udraw.co - and open-source bank of illustrations that can be used for your website.](https://undraw.co/)</em>

## Navbar
This was super easy to build out! In the past, I've been so used to haveing to manually build the button with the image that I wanted, applying a LOT of styling to through CSS to be responsive, and then loading all of the navbar items into it. This built a button as I went, and I just had to type in the list items that I wanted as menu items. Now... there is no way that I will have these class names memorized... I'll be keeping the documentation open for this one.

## Showcase (from example)
Same as above, it was easy to make this responsive along the way versus after-the-fact.
