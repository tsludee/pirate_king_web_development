# pirate_kingdom_web_development
 This is my progress in following the PirateKing's Web Development Course.

 *Disclaimer -- this README is really more of a journal of my progress than anything else.*

I recently read Quincy Larson's book about learning to code and get a developer job. [That can be found here.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/) Something that I really took to heart was getting out of "tutorial hell." I've been doing tutorials for at least 6 years now. I'm really good at reading a book and reproducing the code provided -- maybe I can make a few adjustments along the way or simply adapt what was given to me, but I haven't really stepped out of that and tried to create *my own* project. One of his big "aha" moments was after he *really* paid attention to a tutorial he had done before, and then put it into practice. I am going to start fresh and follow his method.

Today is 7/10/2023. In a year, I plan to be working in tech as a web developer.

## 0. Introduction
PK outlines what needs to be done.

## 1. Visual Studio Code
PK claims that VS Code is the world's best code editor. I like it, too. Although, [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen) may disagree.

(I actually did a full system reset this morning so I did have to reinstall VSCode.)

## 2. HTML
Up first in actual learning is HTML.

This video was great. A lot of stuff I already knew, but a few things that I picked up that I didn't realize! I didn't know the difference between inline and block level elements -- cool to see the "why" behind the use of these tags in different scenarios.

Overall, a great refresher on HTML5.

## 3. CSS
Did it really take me 3 months to complete this? No, I got a new job and that took priority over this. Oops. But I'm back in the saddle again. 

Another great video from Traversy Media. This one taught me a lot about the terminology for certain functions that come about in CSS. I learned/remembered a lot.

Looking ahead, I'm a little daunted because there is so much to do. I've been stuck in "tutorial hell" though! I'm excited to keep perservering though and get beyond where I've been. Bootstrap is something I've never messed with before, so I think that will be a nice "fresh" topic for me to pursue. Then it'll be a lot of things that I've done before, but jQuery will be new, too! And then... It's <strong>all</strong> new.

## 4. Bootstrap
OK - I'm about half an hour into this crash course, but it's time for work, but I have built a navbar and a landing page showcase section. So far, I love Bootstrap. More to come!

Wow. There is a lot going on with Bootstrap. What have I learned from this? READ THE DOCUMENTATION. Holy smokes, there's no way I can memorize all that it can do!

Alright, I have to say, building cards in this was SO MUCH easier than in the past. This was pretty interesting. I recognize that this video had a paid sponsor in Hostinger, but it seemed so easy to use GitHub to push a website and deploy it. I'll be creating my own portfolio in a couple of steps, so... get ready world wide web.
